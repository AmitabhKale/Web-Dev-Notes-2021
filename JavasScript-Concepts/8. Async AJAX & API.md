# Callstack

The Mechaninsm that js-interpreter uses to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functionsâ€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.
```
const multiply = (x,y) => x * y;

const square = (x) => multiply(x,x);

const isRightTriangle = (a,b,c) => {
    return square(a) + square(b) === square(c)
}

isRightTriangle(3,4,5)
```

 - Under sources tab we can debug our js code by putting the break point.

### Heap

Heap is an area in memory where our data is stored

```javascript
// The object is created in the heap. 
// obj is a reference to the object.
var obj = {firstName: "Tim", lastName: "Garcia"};

// New data is not created, it is only a copy of the reference (same area in memory, if value in referenceCopy is changed, it is chanjed in obj as well)
var referenceCopy = obj;
```

#### JavaScript Is Single Threaded

Single Threaded: Code execution is linear; code that is running cannot be interrupted by something else going on in the program

```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Hello from the timeout");
}, 0);
for (var i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
  var x = i * 2;
}
console.log("Done with loop");

// Done with loop
// Hello from the timeout
```

# Callback

- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
```

const posts = [
{title:'Post One', body:'This is Body1'},
{title:'Post Two', body:'This is Body2'}
	]


function getPosts() {
	setTimeout( () => {
		let output = '';
		posts.forEach((post,index) => {
			output += `<li>${post.title}</li>`;

		});
		document.body.innerHTML = output;
	}, 1000)
}

// getPosts();


function createPost(post, callback){
	setTimeout( () => {
		posts.push(post);
		callback();
	},2000)
}

createPost({title:"Post Three", body:"This is Body3"}, getPosts)
```

# Promise
- A promise is an object that represents a task that will be completed in the future.
