- A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
```
let text = "Its a String"
```
We Can use single quotes or double Quotes
```
let username = 'sammy'
```

# Indices and Length

- Strings are Indexed i.e Each Character as a corresponding index(a positional number) 
```
let dish = "CHICKEN";
console.log(dish[0])   // C
console.log(dish[1])   // H 
```
To Calculate number of Characters and spaces we use length.
```
"sometext".length    //8

let month = "january";
month.length;  // 7
```
