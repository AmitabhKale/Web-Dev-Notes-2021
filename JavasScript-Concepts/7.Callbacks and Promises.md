# Callbacks
- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

``Note  :`` JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not in the sequence they are defined. Below code is example of synchronous Programming.
```javascript
const posts = [
    {title:'Post one', body:'This is Post one'},
    {title:'Post Two', body:'This is Post Two'}
]

function getPosts(){
    setTimeout(() => {
        let output = ''
        posts.forEach((post) => {
            output += `<li>${post.title}</li>`;
        } )
        document.body.innerHTML = output
    },1000)
}

function createPost(post){
    setTimeout(() => {
        posts.push(post)
    },2000)
}

getPosts()
createPost( {title:'Post Three', body:'This is Post Three'})

```

The reason we are not gettting post 3 is createpost(2s) is taking much time than getposts(1s)
thats why the asynchronous programming comes in as functions are exceuted in sequence.


### using callback
```javascript
const posts = [
    {title:'Post one', body:'This is Post one'},
    {title:'Post Two', body:'This is Post Two'}
]

function getPosts(){
    setTimeout(() => {
        let output = ''
        posts.forEach((post) => {
            output += `<li>${post.title}</li>`;
        } )
        document.body.innerHTML = output
    },1000)
}

function createPost(post, callback){
    setTimeout(() => {
        posts.push(post)
        callback();
    },2000)
}


createPost( {title:'Post Three', body:'This is Post Three'},getPosts)
```
Here we will get 3 li as output.

### Asynchrounous
Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous.

### Promises
"Producing code" is code that can take some time

"Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result

A Promise is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code

```javascript
const posts = [
    {title:'Post one', body:'This is Post one'},
    {title:'Post Two', body:'This is Post Two'}
]

function getPosts(){
    setTimeout(() => {
        let output = ''
        posts.forEach((post) => {
            output += `<li>${post.title}</li>`;
        } )
        document.body.innerHTML = output
    },1000)
}

function createPost(post){
    return new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            posts.push(post)
            const error = true;
            if(!error){
                resolve();
            }else{
                reject('Error: Something went Wrong')
            }
        },2000)
    })   
}

createPost( {title:'Post Three', body:'This is Post Three'})
.then(getPosts)
.catch(err => console.log(err));
```
