EJS stands for Embedded JavaScript
- We need to install a package for it first
- ``npm install ejs --save``
- It lets us embed JS code (variables, if statements, loops, etc.) inside of html

Usually we don't put .ejs files in the same directory with app.js (we create a separate 'views' directory)
- You can use the method set() to redefine express's default settings.
- ``app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, '/yourViewDirectory'));``
    - Or maybe ``app.set('views','./folder1/folder2/views');``

EJS file:

```html
<h1>You fell in love with: <%= thingVar.toUpperCase() %> <h1>
<!-- everything inside of the '<%= %>' brackets will be treated as a JS code -->
```

App file:

```javascript
app.get('/fallinlovewith/:thing'), function(req, res) {
    var thing = req.params.thing;
    res.render('love.ejs', {thingVar: thing}); // we're passing the variable into the .ejs file; we can put multiple pieces of data to be used in our template
});
```

#### If Statement in EJS

There are three types of tags in ejs:
- <%= %>
    - The value will be returned and added to HTML (without HTML)
- <% %>
    - When we do logic, we don't want to add anything into HTML, we just run the code (control flow)
- <%- %>
    - Includes text with HTML tags (evaluates the code)
    - Could be a dangerous practice
    - Inputs should be sanitazied (getting rid of script tags)
        - express-sanitizer
        - ``req.sanitize(req.body)``

```html
<h1>You fell in love with: <%= thingVar.toUpperCase() %> <h1>

<% if(thingVar.toLowerCase() === 'rusty') { %>
        <p>Good choice!</p>
<% } else { %>
        <p>You should've said Rusty!</p>
<% { %>
```

#### Loop Statement in EJS

App file:

```javascript
app.get('/posts', function(req, res) {
    var posts = [
        {title: 'Post 1', author: 'Susy'},
        {title: 'My adorable pet', author: 'Charlie'},
        {title: 'Look at this puppy', author: 'Colt'},
    ];

    res.render('posts.ejs', {posts: posts});
});
```

Posts.ejs:

```html
<h1>The Posts Page</h1>

<%= posts %>
<!-- [object Object], [object Object], [object Object] -->

<% for (var i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) { %>
    <li>
        <%= posts[i].title %> - <strong><%= posts[i].author %></strong>
    </li>
<% } %>
<!--
Post 1 - Susy
My adorable pet - Charlie
Look at this puppy - Colt
-->

<!-- Also we can use forEach: -->
<% posts.forEach(function(post) { %>
    <li>
        <%= post.title %> - <strong><%= post.author %></strong>
    </li>
<% }); %>
```

### Serving Custom Assets in EJS

We can include public assets (css, js) in EJS files

We create another directory called 'public' (can be named anything) and we put app.css in this folder

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">
<!-- it won't work this way since the default policy of Express is to not serve anything aside from the 'views' directory -->
<!-- but we don't need to specify the path (public/app.css) here -->
```

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public')); // we tell Express to serve the contents of 'public' directory
```

### Making EJS more 'DRY'

#### Getting rid of '.ejs'

We can shorten our code by telling Express that we're going to use '.ejs' ahead of time

```javascript
res.render('home.ejs');

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

res.render('home'); // Express expects these files to be .ejs
```

#### Partials

Partials are the files, templates that we can write and include in other templates
- We can use them to avoid writing html boilerplate or link to css files manually in every .ejs file of our app

To use partials we should create directory 'partials' inside of a 'views' folder and put them there
- Some people call this directory 'layouts'
- The common pratice is to create 'header.ejs' and 'footer.ejs'
    - Although we are not limited to this

Header.ejs:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Demo App</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/app.css">
    </head>
    <body>
```


Note that paths are important
- There is a difference between '/app.css' and 'app.css'
    - The app won't work properly without '/' in 'href'
- When we add the '/' we are telling to look for app.css not in the same directory the template is in, but in a root directory
- We specify the path when we have different elements, e.g.
    - \<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/stylesheets/app.css">
    - \<script src="/scripts/main.js">\</script>

Footer.ejs:

```html
    <p>Copyright 2019</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Including partials:

```html
<% include partials/header %>
<!-- we don't specify .ejs since we told Express to look for .ejs files at 'Getting rid of '.ejs' section' -->

<h1>This is a Demo App</h1>

<% include partials/footer %>
```

### Posts Requests and Body Parsing

```html
<form action="/addfriend" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="newfriend" placeholder="name">
    <button>I made a new friend</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
app.post('/addfriend', function(req, res) {
    res.send('You have reached the post route');
    console.log(req.body);
});
```

Req.body here returns undefined because express (out of the box)doesn't create the request.body, we need to explicitly tell it to take the request.body and turn it into a JS object called request.body
- There is a package for that called body-parser

```javascript
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));

app.post('/addfriend', function(req, res) {
    console.log(req.body.newfriend); // returns what we submitted in the form above
    res.redirect('/friends'); // instead of rendreing a new page or sending something, we often would want to redirect a user
});
```
