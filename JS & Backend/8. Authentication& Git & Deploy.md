## Authentication

### One Way Hashing

It's converting data into a fixed length has string; we can only recreate the hash if we know the original data

Once we have the has, we can't go back and figure out what the original data was

It's applicable for saving passwords on our server - we never save actual password; the data that the site saves should be just hash and nothing else

#### Example of Hashing

Password 'password' -> given to a hash library 'bcrypt' -> $2a$10$9Mconplm8A780pY6iB2q.eBwkdldFbnz2tSH2uqHEi5B9KTpR3O8.

### Sign In (Authentication)

Once we've saved that password as a has, the process of signing is like this:

$2a$10$9Mconplm8A780pY6iB2q.eBwkdldFbnz2tSH2uqHEi5B9KTpR3O8. (in database) -> user provides a password ('password') -> password goes through 'bcrypt' -> hash is generated again -> compare those hashes -> log in

### JWT (JSON Web Token)

jwt.io

Users don't want to enter their passwords on every page; we need some proof that we have logged in in the past

We can use JWTs as proof that we've logged in before - JWT is a web standard for storing signed data (sometimes called 'jot')

JWT Format:

```
Header: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
Payload: eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjM0In0.
Signature: kud-czcx6yOSSQgB0lKbibHNFmlAJwrV8iRQ1Ha-r-Q
```

Signature is used to make sure that the header and the payload has not been tempered with; both the header and the payload, and then also a secret key are inputs to generate the signature
- A secret key is a string that we store on the server but we don't give people access to it (use env variables, install dotenv for connecting to .env file)

The server is the one that keeps track of that secret key, and only it can know about the secret
- If a hacker were to get access to that key then the hacker could also make fake JWTs with whatever header and payload that they want
  - So the thing that keeps this secure is the fact that this signature generation can only be done by the server, it can't be done by the client of by anyone else

#### Authentication

The server verifies the payload and the header to make sure it hasn't been tempered with, and if it hasn't, it looks in the payload to see that it has something like a user ID stored, and then if that user ID is there, that verifies that we've logged in in the past

When the user signs in, we give the generated JWT back to the client; every authenticated request after that the client needs to send us the JWT back (if we're the server)
- As long as the client sends a JWT for which that signature matches the signature that we generate on the server, we are authenticated
- Once we look in this payload, we can see what the user ID is to figure out which user is authenticated
- If something is changed (header, payload, signature) it will lead to an invalid signature problem
  - If the header or payload are different, since they are inputs to generate signature, it will result in the server trying to generate a different signature

#### Sending JWT to Server

The standard way to send the JWT is to include the JWT in the authorization header, and the first part of this header is typically 'Bearer' (type portion of authorization)

HTTP Header: Authorization: Bearer \<JWT> (e.g. Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjM0In0.kud-czcx6yOSSQgB0lKbibHNFmlAJwrV8iRQ1Ha-r-Q)

#### Bcrypt Usage

To see how we use one way hashing with bcrypt is used, go to 'advanced/warbler/warbler-server/models/user.js', '../handlers/auth.js', '../routes/auth.js'

## Auth with Passport.js

Passport.js is used for user authentication
- There are different modules: passport-local (user and password), password-facebook (for facebook auth), etc.

### Getting started

```javascript
var express = require('express'),
    mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    passport = require('passport'),
    LocalStrategy = require('passport-local'),
    passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose'),
    User = require('./models/user');

var app = express(); // this should be on top so the code below would know about app
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session()); // these two lines setting passport up
app.use(require('express-session')({
    secret: 'Pick any sentence, a few English words', // this is used to encode and decode the information in the session
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false // these two lines are required
}));

passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());
passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser()); // these two methods are responsible for reading the session, unencoding data from it (deserialize), and encode and put it back into session (serialize); the methods are added when we plugged passportLocalMonggose into the User model

// in user model:
var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose');

var UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: String,
    password: String
});

UserSchema.plugin(passportLocalMongoose); // it takes this package and adds a bunch of methods to it in order to have a user auth

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

```javascript
// ====================
// ROUTES
// ====================

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('home');
});

app.get('/secret', isLoggedIn, (req, res) => {
  res.render('secret');
});

// ====================
// AUTH ROUTES
// ====================

// show sign up form
app.get('/register', (req, res) => {
  res.render('register');
});
// handling user sign up
app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
  req.body.username
  req.body.password
  User.register(new User({username: req.body.username}), req.body.password, (err, user) => {
    // we make a new User object and we only pass in username (we don't save password to the database straight away)
    // we pass the password as a second argument, it will hash the password and store it (hash will be password, and 'salt' is used to 'unhash' it)
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return res.render('register');
    } else {
      passport.authenticate('local')(req, res, function() {
        // this logs user in, takes care of the session, stores the correct info, runs the serializeUser using the 'local' strategy (can be other, like twitter, facebook)
        res.redirect('/secret'); // example of the page seen only for registered user
      });
    }
  })
});

// LOGIN ROUTES
// login form
app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
  res.render('login');
});
// login logic
app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', {
  // this is a middleware, it is the code that runs before our route callback
  successRedirect: '/secret',
  failureRedirect: '/login'
}), (req, res) => {
});

// log out
app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.logout();
  res.redirect('/');
});

function isLoggedIn(req, res, next) {
  // it is a middleware, args are according to usual naming convention
  // requst obj, response obj, next - next thing that needs to be done (we don't have to set it up, by putting it in as a middleware, express knows what to do next and handles this)
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('login');
}
```

### User

Sending the user info to templates:

```javascript
// to one page:
app.get('/campgrounds', (req, res) => {
  // get campgrounds from DB
  Campground.find({}, (err, allCampgrounds) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      res.render('campgrounds/index', {campgrounds: allCampgrounds, currentUser: req.user}); // sending info about current user
    }
  });
});

// to all pages
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.locals.currentUser = req.user; // whatever we put inside of res.locals is what's available inside of our template
  // req.user is created by express, it contains info about the current user (id and username), undefined if none
  next(); // moving to the next code
});
```

## GIT

GIT is a version control system, it helps you and other collaborators work on the big projects and see the history of the progect changes

GitHub is the largest website with git repositories

### Git basics

#### Git init

Git init is used to 'tell' git that this folder exists, initialize git in the directory
- It works only for this folder and nested folders, and doesn't know about any higher level folders
- Repo is repository, one per project
- Hidden folders start with .
    - Use ls -a to see them
- It makes the directory .git and tracks all of our changes in the files inside of the directory
- .git has all of the git information
- If you initialized it in the wrong directory
    - rm -rf
- Initializing a repo in a folder doesn't mean that it automatically knows and tracks every file and every change that you make
    - E.g. you can tell git to avoid tracking some files with sensitive information (actually just git wouldn't know about it, it would ignore it)

#### Git status

It 'asks' git for a status, usually typed before everything else

#### Git add

Git add is used to tell git about the files we want to track
- git add app.js
- git add .
    - Is used to add all of the stages not stages to commit

#### Git commit

Git commit is used to save the checkpoint, save the files that are added (tracked)
- If there were untracked files before this commit, reverting back to it would make it look like there were any other files which were added later
- git commit -m "add app file"
    - -m is message, every commit should have a message (in present tense)
- Changes should be staged to commit
    - It's a two stage process: modifying the file and then commiting it won't do anything (because we can commit multiple files)
    - If we added a file, and modified some other files, commiting without adding the modified files would make git commit only the new file
    - We need to add files with git add again before commiting

#### Git log

Git log gives all the history, the log of all the commits that we've made in the repo
- Opens a new terminal interface
    - Press Enter or arrows to scroll, you can't type any regular commands
    - To exit press 'Q'


#### Git checkout

It's used for going checking something out, or viewing, to change branches
- If you have some changes, and you go back to view old code, you will lose it so either commit or overwrite
- git checkout \<commit id> (e.g. 71abf9b67466c45eba560660a00216d17b8d3c09) is used to move from master branch
- HEAD detached at \<commit id>
    - HEAD is a point where you are, and here this point is at some older version of the code
        - O -> O -> O -> O (normal workflow, master at the last O)
        - O -> HEAD -> O -> Master (after 'detaching')
    - You can try ls to see that there are no any files which were created past this commit
    - When we use checkout we check the older code and then come back to where we were (sort of transports you back in time)
    - If you try to make changes when HEAD is detached, we run into a problem since we have to make a decision
    - To get back to master: git checkout master

### Git revert

Sometimes you want to revert changes, get back to some old code
- When it comes to deleting changes, it's pretty rare, most developers don't use it often
- There are several ways of getting back to old code (depending if you want to keep commits past that point, or not, etc.)
- One of them git revert --no-commit \<commit we want to revert to>..HEAD and then git commit -m "undo changes" (or smth)
    - This will revert everything from the HEAD back to the commit hash
    - It will recreate that commit state in the working tree as if every commit since had veen walked back
    - --no-commit lets git revert all the commits at once
    - This is a safe and easy way to rollback to a previous state: no history is destroyed, so it can be used for commits that have already been made public
        - We can get back to it using git log
    - If you try to revert while having some unstaged changes, it will give a warning

---

## Deploying

### Environment Variables

Environment is where the code is being run, and its variable e.g. process.env.PORT (PORT is the variable name, usually in CAPS)

Variables that are changed when we change environment (server) of the app (avoiding hardcoding things like ports, IPs, etc.); they are hidden and not exposed to anyone and not related to Node or something else, it's a universal concept

Creating:

```bash
# local
$export DATABASEURL=mongodb://localhost:27017/yelp_camp
# on heroku you need to config vars in settings or
$heroku config:set DATABASEURL=mongodb://Dmitry:Rustyiscool1@ds213615.mlab.com:13615/yelpcamp
```

Accessing:

```javascript
process.env.DATABASEURL;
mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASEURL);
// setting a default value (if a value doesn't exist), it's a good practice
var url = process.env.DATABASEURL || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/yelp_camp';
```

## Useful Modules

### Cors

This a bit of middleware that's going to allow us to make requests that are cross origin (Cross-Origin Resourse Sharing) - we tell our server to send headers in the response that notify the browser that it can actually allow for a cross-origin request

So by default the origin policy is a security policy on the web says that we cannot make those requests because we don't want to write any kind of malicious javascript on another domain

E.g. our backend is going to be starting on localhost 3001, and our frontend application is going to have a different port number, and when there are requests from one domain to another right off the bat, it's a violation of the same origin policy because those port numbers are different

They might both be local hosts but they're still going to be different ports, so we want to allow requests from different domains to come into our API and to do that we're going to use this Cors module - a middleware that's going to allow for certain headers to be sent and set to allow for cross origin requests

### Morgan

Morgan allows us to see request that are coming in to our data (logging)
