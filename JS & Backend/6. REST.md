## REST

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a mapping between HTTP routes and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy), pattern for defining the routes

### RESTful routes

This pattern makes applications more predictable and reliable to interact with other applications
- Note that browser forms don't support PUT or DELETE requests, they return it as a GET
- We need to include method-override to change that
    - Add ?_method=PUT to the action afterwards

<table>
    <tr style="text-align: left">
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>URL</th>
        <th>HTTP Verb</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Mongoose Method</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>INDEX</td>
        <td>/dogs</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>Display a list of all dogs</td>
        <td>Dog.find()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>NEW</td>
        <td>/dogs/new</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>Display a form to create a new dog</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CREATE</td>
        <td>/dogs</td>
        <td>POST</td>
        <td>Create a new dog, then redirect somewhere</td>
        <td>Dog.create()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SHOW</td>
        <td>/dogs/:id</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>Show info about one dog</td>
        <td>Dog.findById()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>EDIT</td>
        <td>/dogs/:id/edit</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>Show edit form for one dog</td>
        <td>Dog.findById()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>UPDATE</td>
        <td>/dogs/:id</td>
        <td>PUT</td>
        <td>Update a particular dog, then redirect somewhere</td>
        <td>Dog.findByIdAndUpdate()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>DESTROY</td>
        <td>/dogs/:id</td>
        <td>DELETE</td>
        <td>Delete a particular dog, then redirect somewhere</td>
        <td>Dog.findByIdAndRemove</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Nested routes:

- We can't do comments/new because this url doesn't have any info about the particular post (e.g. campground in YelpCamp) we're adding this comment to
- We can nest the comment route (make it depended), associating it with the campground:
    - campgrounds/:id/comments/new GET
    - campgrounds/:id/comments POST

## Cleaning Up

### Export

We can clean up the code and make code more modular (we can use models multiple times) with creating separate files and requiring them in our application (we can do this for models, middleware, routes, etc.)

For models:
- Create a directory 'models'
- Separate code into pieces and store them in separate files
    - Note that you need to require all the dependencies in every file-module
- ``module.exports = ``
    - Similar to 'return' of the function
    - You export something out of the model (like post schema that you've created in post.js)
- To require:
    - ``var Post = require('./models/post');``
    - To reference the current directory we use './
    - ***When we require a folder, it will automatically look for index.js***
- ***Models/Index.js***
    - We can put all the needed models into this file so that we require only index.js
    - ``var mongoose = require('mongoose');``
    - ``mongoose.set('debug', true);``
    - ``mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/todo-api', {useNewUrlParser: true});``
    - ``mongoose.Promise = Promise;``
    - ``module.exports.Todo = require('./todo');``
        - Requiring todo.js file and exporting it out
        - When we require the models directory, we're getting require/todo which in turn has schema and model
        - Basically, we're just getting the model out

### Routes Clean Up

We can separate the code in the big file with routes into several categorized ones:

```javascript
// inside of the index route:
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router(); // new instance of the express router

// if there are dependencies:
var User = require('../models/user');
var passport = require('passport');

// *********************
// if we use index.js in models:
var db = require('../models'); // now we can access to a model as db.Model (e.g. db.Todo.find())
// *********************

// replace all 'app' to 'router'
// we're adding routes to router, not in the app itself
// export
module.exports = router;

// inside of app.js
var indexRoutes = require('./routes/index');
app.use(indexRoutes);

// other way to reduce duplication even more (doesn't really work for index routes since thay have no common things in their routes):
app.use('/campgrounds', campgroundRoutes);
// in campgrounds route file replace all '/campgrounds' in routes with '/', e.g.:

router.get('/', (req, res) => { // not /campgrounds
  // get campgrounds from DB
  Campground.find({}, (err, allCampgrounds) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      res.render('campgrounds/index', {
        campgrounds: allCampgrounds
      });
    }
  });
});

router.get('/new', (req, res) => { // not /campgrounds/new
  res.render('campgrounds/new');
});

// for comments:
app.use('/campgrounds/:id/comments', campgroundRoutes);
// although it won't find IDs (req.params.id), and to fix that we need to put this in the comments file (it will merge params from campgrounds and comments):
var router = express.Router({mergeParams: true});
```
