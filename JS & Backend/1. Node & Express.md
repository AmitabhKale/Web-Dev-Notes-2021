## HTTP in Depth

The most important thing that's happening when you go to some website is the 'request-response' cycle and it's independent from a browser

HTTP is hypertext transfer protocol

HTTP verbs are various HTTP requests\
They tell the server what to do, what we're requesting, e.g:
- Get request - we are asking server to get us some data
    - the only request accessible from a browser navbar or search bar
    - searching something is a GET request
        - query string starts with ? and is separated by &
- Post reqiest - we are sending some data with a request to server to be added to database or something
    - some sign up forms or something
- Put and Patch requests are used to update some data
    - update a post on Facebook

When a server gets a 'Delete' request, we expect something to be deleted (but it doesn't happen just because of the request)

Important parts of a response:
- Body of the response (what's sent back)
    - e.g. HTML, CSS, and JS when we are visiting some website
- Headers (metadata about the response)
    - e.g. content type, date, status
- Status (it's a number, a part of the protocol, a standardized way of transferring a status of a response)

## Command Line

Note: Still not sure what to use: cmd, powershell, gitbash or WSL or even Babun (possibly with ConEmu)

- ls shows all of the contents of the current folder we're inside of
    - ``ls dirname`` to see the contents of specific folder
- cd is used to change directories
    - ``cd ..`` to go back one level
    - you can start writing the name of a directory and hit tab to autocomplete it
- touch is used to create new files
    - ``touch orange.txt``
- mkdir is used to create a new folder
    - ``mkdir FavColors``
- rm is used to delete a specific file
    - ``rm orange.txt``
- rm -rf allows us to remove entire directories
    - ``rm -rf colors/``
    - ``rm -rf /`` deletes everything!
    - -rf is a flag, a way to change what the command does
        - stands for 'recursive force'

## Node.js

### What Is Node.js

Node.js is a JS runtime built on Chrome's JS engine
- allowed JS to run not only in the browser
- it is a way to write and run JS on the server side

Node.js's package system, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world

### Node Console

Based on command line, basically we can write JS code in a command line or run a file with node
- although we can't use some things which are available in a browser console like document, alert, etc.

```bash
$node
>'hello ' + 'world'
>'hello world'
# Ctrl+C twice to exit
$node hello.js
```

It is called REPL - Read-Evaluate-Print Loop - is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e., single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user
- exists in many server side languages, e.g. in ruby

### NPM

NPM stands for Node Package Manager; it is a way to include 'libraries' when we write server-side JS

To install a package (the list could be found at npmjs.com):

```bash
$npm install <package name>
# npm install <package name>@version
```

To include a package:

```javascript
var cat = require('cat-me'); // cat-me is the name of a package
```

### Package.json

Package.json is a file with metadata about the project (description, name, version, license, dependencies)

Dependencies are the packages the application relies and needs to work (at runtime)
- React, Express, Redux, etc.

Devdependencies are modules which are only required during development
- Nodemon, Babel, ESLint, Mocha, etc.

The node modules folder is not included in GitHub repositories\
Rather that uploading all of the packages, we can just include information about the required packages in package.json and install them with one command

When installing a package we can add flags to take the package name and version and save it into our package.json file
- --save (``npm i -S``) to save it as a depenpency
- --save-dev (``npm i -D``) to save it as a devDependency
- After node version 9 we can omit ``--save`` flag

To create a package.json we can use ``npm init`` command and then follow the instructions

```bash
$npm init

name: #name of the folder by default
version: #(1.0.0) by default
description:
enrty point: #the file where our application starts, index.js by default
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: #ISC by default
```

### Express framework

A library is a code that someone else wrote and we can include and use in our app

A framework is almost the same, but the way that we use it is different\
The most inportant difference is Inversion of Control
- When you call a library, you are in control
    - Library is a collection of functionality that you can call
- When with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you
    - This is called the Hollywood principle: Don't call Us, We'll call You
    - Basically, all the control flow is already in the framework, and there's just a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with your code

Types of frameworks:
- heavy (opinionated)
    - heavyweight framework has little 'blanks' that you fill in; apps are created faster but sometimes you have no idea what's going on behind the scenes
    - Rails
- light (unopinionated)
    - lightweight framework has more blanks and more frequently across the code; more flexible
    - Express

Express is a lightweight web development framework

#### Usage of Express

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express(); // that includes all the contents of express and saves into a variable

// '/' => 'Hi there!'
app.get('/', /*middleware */ function(req, res) {
    // request and response (could be anything, but it's the regular naming policy)
    // request (Obj) contains all the info about the request that was made
    // response (Obj) contains all the info about what we're going to respond with
    res.send('Hi there');
});

// '/bye' => 'Goodbye!'
app.get('/bye', function(req, res) {
    res.send('Goodbye!');
});

// tell Express to listen for requests (start server)
app.listen(3000, function() {
    console.log('Serving app on port 3000');
});

// for c9:
// app.listen(process.env.PORT, process.env.IP, function() {
//     console.log('Server has started');
// });

// process.env.PORT is an enviroment variable which is called PORT, it will return a number which comes from c9
// process.env.IP tells express to listen from a particular IP
```

#### Folder Structure

One pattern of folder structure of an Express app

- handlers
    - functions that we pass to our routes
- routes
    - routes for our app
- middleware
    - middleware functions
- models
    - database models
- views
    - page templates, if we don't use front-end framework
- public
    - assets for our app if we don't use front-end framework
- index.js

### Routes and Route Parameters

Routes are how we listen for a particular request, and then run some other code depending on the request that we get

#### Splat or Star Route Matcher

We use * to have some sort of catch-all, some message we respond to every other route that we didn't specify, e.g. show an error message if page is not found

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// it should be located at the bottom of the app
app.get('*', function(req, res) {
    res.send('You are a star');
});
```

#### Order of Routes

Order of routes matters
- The first route that matches is the only route that will be run
- If we put a * route before anything else, we will never have any other code run

#### Route parameters

Websites (e.g. Reddit) don't have all the routes written in their code, like:

```javascript
app.get('/r/soccer');
app.get('/r/music');
app.get('/r/movies');
```

Instead we create patterns by making use of route (path) parameters (variables)

```javascript
app.get('/r/subredditName'); // works only for '/r/subredditName'
app.get('/r/:subredditName'); // creates a pattern where we listen for get request for '/r/' and anything afterwards

// website.com/r/soccer would work
// website.com/r/soccer/hello wouldn't work because it's a different pattern

app.get('/r/:subredditName/comments/:id/:title/');
```

We can access the data inside of our route handler

```javascript
app.get('/r/:subredditName', function(req, res) {
    var subreddit = req.params.subredditName;
    res.send('WELCOME TO THE ' + subreddit.toUpperCase() + ' SUBREDDIT');
});

// /r/soccer
// WELCOME TO THE SOCCER SUBREDDIT
// /r/cats/
// WELCOME TO THE CATS SUBREDDIT
```

---

### Templates and EJS

When we use Express, to render a page, we don't write plain html files, we need dynamic html files which are called 'templates'

```javascript
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.render('home.ejs'); // we can send back the contents of a file
})
```
