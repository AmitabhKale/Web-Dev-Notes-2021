 ## APIs

### Intro to API's

Application Programming Interface(API) in a broad sense is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and applications

It is a way to connect with other applications, interface which allows two systems to communicate with one another
- It could be a database API (locally)
- Video card API
- API to incorporate graphical elements
- Web APIs

Web APIs generally communicate via HTTP
- Twitter API 'give me all tweets that mention "ice cream"'
- Reddit API 'what is the current top post?'
- Weather API 'what is the weather in New York?'
- Some APIs can be found at programmableweb.com

#### API Endpoint


An endpoint is one end of a communication channel
- When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints
- For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service
- Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function
- Endpoints specify where resources can be accessed by APIs and play a key role in guaranteeing the correct functioning of the software that interacts with it
- API performance relies on its ability to communicate effectively with API Endpoints

### JSON and XML

When we use the internet, we make HTTP request and get HTML back

APIs don't respond with HTML because HTML contains info about the structure of the page, and APIs respond with data, not structure
- They use simpler data formats like XML and JSON

#### XML

XML stands for Extended Markup Language
- It is syntacticly similar to HTML, but it does not describe presentation like HTML does

```xml
<person>
    <age>21</age>
    <name>Travis</name>
    <city>Los Angeles</city>
</person>
```

#### JSON

JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation
- JSON looks exactly like JavaScript objects, but everything is a string

```json
{
    "person": {
        "age": "21",
        "name": "Travis",
        "city": "Los Angeles"
    }
}
```

### Making Requests with Node.js

We can make requests from a browser, from a command line

```bash
$curl http://www.google.com
```

Inside of an application we can make requests by using a package 'request'
- usually we recieve data as a string
- to get data as a JSON use ``JSON.parse(data)``

```javascript
var request = require('request');
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
    if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(body); // show the HTML for the Google homepage
    }
});

request('http://someAPI.com', function (error, response, body) {
    // another way of writing
    if (error) {
        console.log('Something went wrong');
        console.log(error);
    } else {
        if (response.statusCode == 200) {
            var parsedData = JSON.parse(body);
            console.log(body); // string
            console.log(parsedData); // object
            console.log(['query']['results']); // prints data in 'query -> results'
        }
    }
})
```
