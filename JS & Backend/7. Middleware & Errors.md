# Middleware
Express Middleware are function that run during the request/response LifeCycle
- Middleware are just Functions
- Each Middleware has access to the request and response objects
- Middleware can end with the HTTP request by sending back a response with methods like res.send()
- OR middleware can br chained together,one after another by calling next()

## Using Morgan-Logger Middleware
In Basic Express Server App Install the morgan package

```
npm i morgan
```

Example: This will output a log 
```
var express = require('express')
var morgan = require('morgan')

var app = express()

app.use(morgan('tiny'))

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('hello, world!')
})
```
